## Overview
*The Paw Bandit* is a short 2D stealth-adventure game created in just a few days for the **ScoreSpace Game Jam**.  
In this game, you play as a clever thief sneaking through a museum filled with valuable artifacts, security cameras, and patrolling guards.  
Your goal is to **steal the target item** and **escape before time runs out**, using your agility and creativity to avoid detection.

## Gameplay
Each level challenges you to plan your moves carefully while staying hidden from guards and cameras.  
There are multiple mechanics and tools available such as corners to use and hide, box hiding mechanics, cameras to look out for and sneak mode that allow for different playstyles and routes — speed, stealth, or pure chaos.  
Players can replay to improve their timing and discover new tricks for the best possible score.

**Core Mechanics:**
- Timed missions with increasing difficulty.  
- Smart enemy AI and camera systems that react to your movement.  
- Fun interactive environment objects that create new ways to escape.  
- Replayable levels with leaderboards and time-based challenges.  

## Development
*The Paw Bandit* was built collaboratively during a short game jam.  
The focus was on quick prototyping, level design, and balancing the mechanics to make every attempt feel unique.  
Despite being developed in just a few days, the team managed to create a polished, fast-paced stealth experience with charming pixel art visuals.

## My Role and Contributions
I worked as a **Coder** and **Game Designer**.  
My responsibilities included programming the **player movement system**, **enemy AI logic**, and **interactive objects** (like switches, lights, and security features).  
I also helped design the **level flow**, balancing difficulty and timing to create tension and fun for players trying to perfect their heist.
